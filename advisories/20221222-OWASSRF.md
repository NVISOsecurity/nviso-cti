## NVISO CSIRT ADVISORY 

**Last Updated: 2022-12-21**

 

## SUMMARY 

In this advisory we provide an overview of a recently reported exploit method targeting Microsoft Exchange servers. We will be updating this advisory continuously as more information is released. 
Crowdstrike reported on 20th December about a previously undiscovered exploit method targeting Microsoft Exchange servers. It consists of a combination of likely CVE-2022-41080 and CVE-2022-41082 to gain Remote Code Execution (RCE) via Outlook Web Access (OWA). This exploit method was discovered while Crowdstrike investigated the initial intrusion vector in various ‘Play’ ransomware cases. Crowdstrike assigned the term “OWASSRF” to this exploit method. 
CVE-2022-41082 is a vulnerability that is exploited to gain Remote Code Execution and part of the exploit method known as ‘ProxyNotShell’. The new method ‘OWASSRF’ and ‘ProxyNotShell’ differentiate in the vulnerability that is used to trigger CVE-2022-41082. ‘ProxyNotShell’ uses CVE-2022-41040, while ‘OWASSRF’ likely uses CVE-2022-41080.

As the above image shows, the entry point for the different methods differs. This also clearly indicates that the rewriting rules aiming at the ‘Autodiscover’ endpoint will not be effective against ‘OWASSRF’. Rewriting rules aiming at ‘Autodiscover’ have been suggested workarounds for ‘ProxyNotShell’ 
Crowdstrike successfully replicated the exploit method by utilizing leaked threat actor’s tooling against systems which do no have the November 2022 Security Patch (KB5019758) applied. On systems with the aforementioned patch applied, Crowdstrike researchers have been unsuccessful in replicating ‘OWASSRF’.  Based on this observation and the vulnerabilities KB5019758 addresses, Crowdstrike assesses it is highly likely that ‘OWASSRF’ uses CVE-2022-41080.  

## WHY THIS MATTERS 

Affected exchange servers might have been protected in the past by applying incomplete workarounds (rewriting rules). These servers should be considered vulnerable again, as a new exploit method has been discovered in the wild.  

## AFFECTED PRODUCTS 

Microsoft Exchange Server 2019 

Microsoft Exchange Server 2016 

Microsoft Exchange Server 2013 

For a detailed list please see the original Microsoft Advisory listed below.  

 
## AVAILABLE WORKAROUNDS 

If the patch cannot be applied, it is recommended to disable Outlook Web Access (OWA) if possible. Additionally, remote PowerShell for non-admin users should be disabled where possible. (see MORE INFORMATION section) 

## AVAILABLE PATCHES 

November Security update for Microsoft Exchange Server 2019, 2016, and 2013 (KB5019758) 

## CVSS SCORE AND CVE ID 

CVE ID	|Severity	|CVSSv3 Score|

## RECOMMENDED ACTIONS 

It is advised to identify Exchange servers which have not been supplied with the November 2022 patch. Critical risk vulnerabilities should be fully patched as soon as possible. 

Monitor IIS logs for the following pattern, as it has been reported by Crowdstrike to be related to `‘OWASSRF’: ‘POST /owa/<email_address>/powershell’`
