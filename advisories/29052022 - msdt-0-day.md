# Summary

On May 27th a malicious document, maldoc, was discovered which loads HTML content. In the HTML a script is defined that leverages the "ms-msdt" scheme to achieve code execution on a system.

This vulnerability has been dubbed “Follina” by security researcher Kevin Beaumont, https://twitter.com/GossiTheDog. 

The "ms-msdt" scheme is part of the Microsoft Office URI schemes which instructs the Microsoft operating system to open a URI with a specific executable. 

As an example, the URI ms-excel:ofv|u|https://contoso/Q4/budget.xls would start the application that is linked to the ms-excel scheme, in most cases that would be Microsoft Excel.

# Why this matters

The abuse of the ms-msdt scheme reaches further than just the creation of Maldocs. Any application supporting the MS Protocols could be a potential payload carrier. MS Outlook and .lnk files have already been identified as attack vectors.

The technique doesn't require any user interaction, as soon as the malicious carrier (email, .lnk, office document ...) is opened, code execution will be achieved.

From our internal testing we have found that a fully patched Windows 10 is affected; This exploitation tactic works on a Windows 10 machine 21H2 that we last updated on 30/05/2022.

Exploitation has been detected in the wild as far back as April, 2022. As seen here: (1) crazyman_army on Twitter: "https://t.co/Zr1F9wm7F3" / Twitter

A larger list of supported schemes has been identified by SySS which contained among others also the ms-msdt scheme. As it appears now the ms-msdt scheme can be leveraged to achieve code execution.

The initial maldoc was only identified by 6 different AV vendors on VirusTotal:

That detection rate has increase to 15/60 as of 8:38 CET 30/05/2022.

# Detection & Prevention

*If you are an NVISO MSS customer, we have already pushed rules into your Microsoft Defender for Endpoint or Cortex XDR solutions for detection of these threats.*

In order to detect the abuse of the ms-msdt scheme, a quick win would be to monitor for Office Applications spawning the "msdt.exe" program. A Defender for Endpoint query has already been created by Kevin Beaumont, see below.

```
DeviceProcessEvents
| where ProcessCommandLine contains "msdt.exe"| where InitiatingProcessFileName has_any (@"WINWORD.EXE", @"EXCEL.EXE", @"OUTLOOK.EXE")
```

The Attack Surface Reduction (ASR) rule for "Block all Office applications from creating child processes" is able to mitigate this threat if properly deployed as well. 
You can enable this rule by running this command in an elevated PowerShell prompt:

```
Set-MpPreference -AttackSurfaceReductionRules_Ids d4f940ab-401b-4efc-aadc-ad5f3c50688a -AttackSurfaceReductionRules_Actions Enabled
```

Quick fix:

You could delete the ms-msdt handler from the registry or remap it to another program to break its functionality. (1) Samir on Twitter: "@neutroncore @GossiTheDog this looks like a quick temp fix (change ms-msdt default handler) https://t.co/EEf4jsB3Uy" / Twitter
