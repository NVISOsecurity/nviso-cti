## SUMMARY
As part of the June 2021 Patch Tuesday, Microsoft released a patch for CVE-2021-1675. This patch fixed a vulnerability in the Windows Print Spooler service which would allow a user to perform Local Privilege Escalation. Recently, Proof of Concept (PoC) code has been released that confirms this vulnerability can also be abused in a Remote Code Execution (RCE) attack. 

## WHY THIS MATTERS
This vulnerability allows for full remote code execution on the target system, additionally, this vulnerability can also be used without authentication in order to attempt local privilege escalation. Following the proof of concept code being leaked, it is expected to see widespread attacks happening soon. This vulnerability is likely to be used in the second stage of an attack to spread laterally or to gain domain admin privileges. However, if the Print Spooler service is exposed to the internet it could also be used as an initial infection vector. 

## AFFECTED PRODUCTS
All Windows OS versions

## AVAILABLE WORKAROUNDS
Disable the print spooler service on all machines or disable the service on machines that have elevated privileges such as Domain Controllers and other administrative systems. Note that printer pruning will not be functional after disabling this service, however, this functionality is rarely used.

## CVSS SCORE AND CVE ID
|CVE ID	|Severity	|CVSSv2 Score	|CVSSv3 Score	|Patching Timeframe|
|-------|---------|-------------|-------------|------------------|
|CVE-2021-01675	|High	|6.8	|7.8	|5 days|

Note: this vulnerability is also known as PrintNightmare.

NIST: http://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-1675 

MITRE: https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-1675 

## RECOMMENDED ACTIONS
High risk vulnerabilities are strongly advised to be patched within 5 days of this notice. Due to the release of additional exploit proof of concept code we believe this should be patched as soon as possible due to the increased risk.

As this vulnerability could also be abused to gain initial access into the network, it is advised to ensure any device running the print spooler service is not exposed to the internet.

Additionally, a SIGMA rule was released to monitor for exploitation. This can be further modified to work in additional SIEMs and track unauthorized driver updates.
